# Robot competing in the _Coupe de France de robotique_

The main task of this robot is simply to move on a board (including slopes) and push hockey pucks.
This robot was design in hurry, it lacks some features to mount the electronic. Its weird shapes is due to the requirement of the competition, the robot needs to be 40cm tall.
